23. **If you were building this, what would you do differently than typical marketplace playbooks?**

24. **When pursuing VC, at what point do we risk losing control (board seats, veto rights, preference stack)? How can we plan for that?**

25. **Would incorporating AI (e.g., intake triage, drafting, summaries) materially improve defensibility or is it noise to investors right now?**
